# üì± Salesperson Tracker Mobile App

> Ignite-based React Native iOS app with native always-on location tracking

This mobile app tracks salesperson visits to assigned accounts using native iOS background location capabilities that work even when the app is completely closed.

## üéØ **Key Features**
- **Always-on tracking**: Native iOS module works when app is closed
- **Battery efficient**: Uses iOS Significant Location Changes (SLC)
- **Real-time sync**: Direct Supabase API integration
- **Offline queueing**: Local storage for network outages
- **Professional UI**: Tab-based navigation with Ignite components

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Physical Device Required**
**iOS Simulator does NOT support background location tracking. You must test on a physical iPhone/iPad.**

See [iOS Native Location Setup Guide](../../IOS_NATIVE_LOCATION_SETUP.md) for complete configuration instructions.

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

To make things work on your local simulator, or on your phone, you need first to [run `eas build`](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/expo/EAS.md). We have many shortcuts on `package.json` to make it easier:

```bash
yarn build:ios:sim # build for ios simulator
yarn build:ios:dev # build for ios device
yarn build:ios:prod # build for ios device
```

### `./assets` directory

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```tree
assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icons
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images
```

**icons**
This is where your icon assets will live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/boilerplate/app/components/Icon.md).

**images**
This is where your images will live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. You can use various formats such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use your `icon` or `image` assets:

```typescript
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```
